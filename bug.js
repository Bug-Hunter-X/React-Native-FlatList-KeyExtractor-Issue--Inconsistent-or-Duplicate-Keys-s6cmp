In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error can occur if you're not careful about managing the keys prop.  If the keys are not unique across all items in the dataset, React Native may not render items correctly or might cause unexpected behavior like components not updating or flickering.  This is often seen when the data source is dynamically updated, and the key generation is inconsistent, resulting in duplicate keys or keys that change unexpectedly.  Here's an example:

```javascript
const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' } // Duplicate key!
];

<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Incorrect keyExtractor
/>
```

In this example, using `item.id` as the keyExtractor will lead to problems since 'id' 1 is duplicated.
